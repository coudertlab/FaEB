# FaEB

Fast Energy Barrier (FaEB) evaluation tool to assess diffusion in nanoporous materials based on Gemmi symmetrical energy grids.

## Installation

Check if you have `c++11` compiler installed (may work with other compiler but has been tested and mainly used with this compiler).

Tested for c++ (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0

Compilation that follows the rules set in the `Makefile`:
```
make all
```

## How to use it

```
./faeb structure/KAXQIL_clean_14.cif forcefield/UFF.def 298 12 Xe 0.12
```

You can replace the structure and forcefield files and the other parameters.

The results are printed in a comma separated (csv) format: 

```
structure, adsorption enthalpy (kJ/mol), Henry coefficient (mol/kg/Pa), Basin energy (kJ/mol), Transition state energy (kJ/mol), Time (s)
```
```
KAXQIL_clean_14,-44.626,0.0300725,-44.3181,-25.8181,1.78605
```

To get Barrier energy, you simply need to substract the TS energy by the basin energy.
